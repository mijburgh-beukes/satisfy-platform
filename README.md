# Satisfy-platform
Volunteer project for an NPO that bridges the gap by re-directing the abundance of food in our community to where it is needed.

## The project
[Satisfy Food Rescue](https://www.satisfyfoodrescue.org.nz/) is a non-profit organisation that liases directly with other organisations to redistribute food that would otherwise go to waste.

I approached them offering my services as a software developer to help overcome some of their day-to-day pain points. We've only had initial discussions and are yet to draw up a full project plan, but the crux of the idea is to create a platform for them to manage their data, be it scheduling of volunteers or creating reports to present to the relevant authorities in order to get funding.

This project will be an avenue for me to get practice in on existing knowledge, as well as learning new technologies.

If you're interested in collaborating on the project, feel free to flick me a [message](mailto:mijburgh.beukes@gmail.com).
